        There. Now that that is over with I will proceed to tell you about
this program.  "Wonder" is a simple Turbo C program that displays a changing
kaleidiscope of lines on your screen.  I wrote it just for fun and to see if
I could do it.  You can control the speed of the changes, and whether or not
a background color will be used.  You can also pause the image and clear the
screen if you so desire.  To end the program simply press escape.  To change
the speed press the numbers '0' to '9', (0 is fastest).
	Included files within Wonder.zip are:
                             Wonder.exe  (the program)
                             Wonder.txt  (this file)
                             Wonder.ico  (a windows icon file)
                             Wonder.c    (the source file)
			     Egavga.bgi  (required graphics file for Ega/Vga
 monitors.  If you have another kind of monitor, the program will need the
.bgi file that corresponds to that monitor type.  The correct .bgi file must
be within your dos path or in the same directory as wonder.exe or else you
will get an error message.  I did not include those files because it is
likely they are already on your system and they would just slow down
download time.  To find the .bgi file needed for your monitor on your hard
disk, use the command DIR *.BGI /S at the root command prompt.)
        If you have any comments, good or bad, or even bug reports, send
