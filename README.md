        There. Now that that is over with I will proceed to tell you about
this program.  "Wonder" is a simple Turbo C program that displays a changing
kaleidiscope of lines on your screen.  I wrote this program from scratch to
see if I could after I saw the program "KALEIDESCOPE" written by Joseph
McClendon.  This program, however, goes much farther than that one.  Here is
a rundown of your options:

        'B':            Toggles the background on and off.

        'C':            Clears the screen and starts over.

        'P':            Pauses the screen until a key is pressed.

        '0' to '9':     Changes the delay time between writing lines on the
                        display.  '0' is the fastest, and '9' is the slowest.

        '' and ''     Change the maximum space allowed between lines on the
        (right & left   screen.  When you exceed the boundaries in either
           arrow keys)  direction you will be notified with a "beep."  The
                        lower boundry is 1, and the upper boundry is 9.

        'F'             Toggles between the kaleidescope taking up the full
                        screen and just taking up the largest possible square
                        of area in the center of the screen.

        'D'             Will set the startup default parameters to those
                        currently on the screen.  This creates the file
                        "wonder.def" in the current working directory.  If
                        this file is not present in the same directory as the
                        program, the program will use the defaults of
                        delay = 0, background = OFF, space = 4, and full
                        screen mode = OFF.

        'H'             Displays the beginning help screen.

        'Esc'           Terminate program.

Included files within Wonder.zip are:
                        Wonder.exe  (the program)
                        Wonder.txt  (this file)
                        Wonder.ico  (a windows icon file)
                        Wonder.c    (the source file)
                        Egavga.bgi  (required graphics driver for Ega/Vga
        monitors.  If you have a different monitor type you can still use
        this program.  You will know this if you get an error message after
        the intro screen.  To see if you have the required driver file already
        on your system go to the root prompt of all of your hard drives.  (For
        the C: drive this will be the C:\ prompt.)  Then type
        dir (filename.bgi) /s and press enter. (If you have a version of DOS
        befor 5.0 the /s switch will not work.)  If the file is there copy it
        from its current directory to the one with the wonder.exe file in it.
        Restart the program and it should work.  If you don't have the file
        on your system GO IBMFF on Compuserve and search for that file.  You
        should be able to find it there.)
